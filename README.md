# Capsone Exercise

Build a mobile app that meets the following criteria
An app that
- enables a user to create a new form using a "configuration file"
- Users can fill out the form and save the records offline
- Users can export data offline (in CSV)

## Key component
- Configuration file: a JSON file structure that contains questions and field types. This file is downloaded or stored on the user's device where the mobile app accesses it and renders a questionnaire interface as specified on the config file to the user.
- Download a sample configuration file designed to create a form for a building mapping project config file
- Offline record: the app should store all offline records using the ROOMDatabase.
- Synch to Cloud (optional): the cloud should be a Google live sheet, when users sync to the cloud all data is pushed to a live Google sheet.
## Extra Points 
(not compulsory but give significant proof of capability for the role
- Skip Logic: The config file should be able to skip logic e.g. (if question #1 selected answer is NO is no, skip to question 4). This logic guides the user when filling ouf the form

## Deliverable

- A compiled APK file: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lrJFfaMxWqauRr9v5XnU7nQ1fHQp4B9D/view?usp=sharing
- Github URL to the codebase: https://github.com/ashaluwalakazeem/Capstone-Kazeem
- URL to the live Google Excel sheet (if "synch to the cloud" was implemented): https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y05DXWOEqldnBzF5yjRMwgfFsDxBvWhCBgP_A6d3dZM/edit?usp=sharing
- A screen record video showing what you built: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bBkHY_Qu3T9g6QEJrOC1C8nqkGGkHiCG/view?usp=sharing
- A sample configuration file that can be used to test the implemenation: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zZEFBFQpY6x1V-sdps6BK-OIrVFnxUnU/view?usp=sharing


## Important Noted:

- The system must be built using Kotlin
- Don't bother much about Ul or UX, we are after your thinking quality,and functionality of the system
- Extra point tasks are not mandatory but give greater chances (if any or all of them are attended to)
